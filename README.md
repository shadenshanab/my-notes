 ### Good Developers
 
> Developers often face many problems while makin their projects, these seem harmless sometimes but with time, and as more and more of these stack up, horror stories arise.

> So, in order to avoid those errors, you should have a developer mindset that will help you make better decisions.

1. you should understand the purose of your software.
> Developers who cannot envision the software's purpose will create a complicated system that does not offer much assistance to people.
When making software decisions, you should focus on how you can help and can even prioritize feature requests this way.

2. Know the goals of your design.
>A good software design will help a developer focus on what's important, which is helping the user. The design must be easy for you and helpful for everyone else.

3. Misunderstanding
>you should understand your code to make it less complex.

4. simplicity
>As a good developer you should make your code and system as simple and understandable as possible.

5. complexity
>Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

6. Maintenance
>It is more important to reduce maintenance effort than it is to reduce implementation effort.

7. Consistency
>Code that is inconsistent becomes more difficult to understand. Don't keep forcing developers to relearn how your system works with each new piece of it.

8. Prioritizing
>Changes that provide a lot of value while requiring little effort are preferable to those that provide little value while requiring a lot of effort.

9. Solving Problems
> know how to solve the problems that arise.

10. Good enough is fine
>Don't over-complicate the code or program just to impress, just do what's needed.
